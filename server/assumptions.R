        "<ul>",
        "<li><b>Representative length measurements:</b> The method assumes that the dataset is representative of the length distributions of the whole catch. This means that either the length of all individuals in the catch were measured or a randomized subsample of the catch was measured.</li>",
        "<li><b>Gear/fleet selectivity:</b> The method assumes sigmoidal selectivity, as commonly assumed for 'trawl-like' fishing gear. While gillnets and hook-based methods often have bell-shaped selectivity, the use of mixed mesh/hook sizes may result in an overall trawl-like selectivity.</li>",
        "<li><b>Equilibrium conditions:</b> The model assumes constant recruitment, fishing mortality, natural mortality, growth, and maturation within and across all years covered by the dataset.</li>",
        "<li><b>Density dependence:</b> The model assumes that maturity and somatic growth are independent of population density. All reference points are based on a per recruit model, without assuming a stock-recruitment relationship.</li>",
        "<li><b>Correlation of life-history parameters:</b> When natural mortality is estimated from empirical formulae, the model assumes that growth parameters (e.g., <i>Lâˆž</i> and <i>K</i>) are reliable predictors of natural mortality.</li>",
        "<li><b>Length-independent natural mortality:</b> The current implementation of SMT assumes that the natural mortality is equal for all length classes.</li>",
        "<li><b>Somatic growth follows VBG:</b> Growth estimation with ELEFAN assumes logistic von Bertalanffy growth (VBG). While common for fish, this assumption may not hold for species with exoskeletons (e.g., crustaceans) or for early life stages.</li>",
        "<li><b>Closed population:</b> The method assumes no immigration or emigration. Violations of this assumption may bias estimates of mortality and stock status, especially if migration patterns vary by life stage.</li>",
